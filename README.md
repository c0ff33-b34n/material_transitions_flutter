# Codelab: Building Beautiful Transitions with Material Motion for Flutter

The Material motion system for Flutter is a set of transition patterns within
the [Animations package](https://pub.dev/packages/animations) that can help
users understand and navigate an app, as described in the
[Material Design guidelines](https://material.io/design/motion/the-motion-system.html).

This repo houses the source for the
[Material motion system codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/material-motion-flutter),
during which we build Material transitions into an example email app
called Reply.

The transitions added to the app in this codelab:
- Container Transform transition from email list to email detail page
- Container Transform transition from FAB to compose email page
- Shared Z-Axis transition from search icon to search view page
- Fade Through transition between mailbox pages
- Fade Through transition between compose and reply FAB
- Fade Through transition between disappearing mailbox title
- Fade Through transition between bottom app bar actions

The starter code is available on the default `starter` branch, and the complete
code is available on `main` branch.
